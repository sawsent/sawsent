## About Me
I'm a learning junkie that thrives in challenging environments. I love to adapt and take on new challenges. With a background in sales and my own business in animated explainers, I blend creativity with technology. A classically trained violinist and a lover of mathematics and physics, I seek to innovate and inspire. I also love gaming and was a semi-pro Valorant player.
